Program Coordinator
Program | Austin, TX | Full Time
Job Description
BACKGROUND
The Colorado River Alliance (the Alliance) is a not-for-profit organization that champions the long-term vitality of the Texas Colorado River through education and engagement. (More info at www.ColoradoRiver.org.) We are seeking a Program Coordinator to manage one of the Alliance’s signature education initiatives, the Mobile River Program. Launched in 2015 and featuring the award-winning Texas Colorado River Rolling Exhibit (a.k.a., the Mobile River), this program’s primary audience is Austin Independent School District 7th graders and educators. In addition, this water-science-center-on-wheels visits community events and, on occasional one- and two-week trips, middle schools across the state within the Texas Colorado River’s watershed. The program was developed to help students, including at-risk and underserved students, learn vital concepts such as water conservation, aquatic science, the uses of water, and healthy river ecosystems. Our goal is to inspire the next generation of water scientists and leaders. The Mobile River was developed and operates in partnership with the City of Austin’s water utility, Austin Water, and the Austin Independent School District. A short video about this program is available here.
The Program Coordinator’s principal duties focus on (1) coordinating with school personnel and managing a robust school-visit program for 5,500 7th-grade students annually, along with visits to about 10 community events per year; (2) training and coaching 7th-grade teachers daily on using the Mobile River’s curriculum units, classroom models, and instructional materials; and (3) managing the operating systems of a mobile science center, including electrical and computer systems, fuel and HVAC systems, technology-based exhibit functions, and trailer set-up and close-down.
